# bem-core Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bem/bem-core.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bem/bem-core)

This README is also available [in Russian](http://ru.bem.info/libs/bem-core/).

## What is this?

`bem-core` is a base library for web interface development.
It provides the minimal stack for coding client-side JavaScript and templating.

## Use

The easiest way to run a project with `bem-core` is to use
the [project-stub](https://github.com/bem/project-stub).

You can use any other way you are familiar with to include the library into
the project.

## Inside

### Levels
  - `common.blocks` — suited for any devices and browsers
  - `desktop.blocks` — should be used for desktop browsers
  - `touch.blocks` — implement some touch-platforms specifics

### Blocks
  - `i-bem` — base block with helpers for JS and HTML
  - `ecma` — some ES5 polyfils
  - `strings` — helpers for JS-strings
  - `objects` — helpers for JS-objects
  - `functions` — helpers for JS-functions
  - `events` — JS-events
  - `querystring` — helpers for work with querystring
  - `tick` — global timer
  - `idle` — IDLE event
  - `next-tick` — polyfill for `nextTick`/`setTimeout(0, ...)`
  - `inherit` — OOP helpers
  - `jquery` — jQuery
  - `clearfix` — CSS clearfix trick
  - `identify` — identify JS-objects
  - `cookie` — helpers for work with browser cookies
  - `vow` — Promises/A+ implementation

## Changelog

You can check the changelog at the [changelog page](http://bem.info/libs/bem-core/changelog/).

## Migration

If you used BEM before, check the [migration instructions](http://bem.info/libs/bem-core/migration/).

## Development

### Working copy

1. Get the needed version code (e.g., `v1`):
```
$ git clone -b v1 git://github.com/bem/bem-core.git
$ cd bem-core
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

You need `export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH`
or an alternative way to run locally-installed [bem-tools](https://github.com/bem/bem-tools).

3. Install all the necessary libraries:
```
$ bem make libs
```

4. Build examples and tests:
```
$ bem make sets
```

5. Run development server:
```
$ bem server
```

### How to contribute

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/new) with a proper
description.
2. Decide which version needs your changes.
3. Create a feature-branch with an issue number and a version (`issues/<issue
number>@v<version number>`) based on a version branch.
For example, for an issue #42 and a version #1: `git checkout -b issues/42@v1 v1`.
If you need changes for several versions, each of them has to have a feature
branch.
4. Commit changes and `push`. Rebase your branch on a corresponding version
branch if it's needed.
5. Create a pull-request from your feature branch; or several pull-requests if
you changed several versions.
6. Link your pull request with an issue number any way you like. A comment will work
perfectly.
7. Wait for your pull request and the issue to be closed ;-)

### Modular testing

A default test bundle for `ecma_array`:
```
$ bem make desktop.specs/ecma__array
```

You can see the results of the tests in the terminal after the building process
finishes.
You can also watch them in a browser loading `desktop.specs/ecma__array/spec-js+browser-js+bemhtml/spec-js+browser-js+bemhtml.html`.

Run tests for other BEM entities in the same way. This will work for those which
are equipped with `.spec.js` file.

Test are built with a [bem-pr](https://github.com/narqo/bem-pr) library.
Check the
[details](https://github.com/narqo/bem-pr/blob/master/docs/tests.ru.md)
about testing infrastructure of the bem-pr.

## Supported browsers
Our browser support policy is based on statistics we get from [Yandex](http://company.yandex.com) services.

Browsers with more than 2% users get full compliant support, more than 0.5% — partially compliant
(which means that data is accessible but not necessary 100% functional). New features testing
is not provided by us for  browsers with less than 0.5% users.

  - MSIE 8.0
  - Opera 12.15

#### Partially compliant
  - Opera 17.0
  - Opera 16.0
  - Opera 12.14
  - Opera 12.2
