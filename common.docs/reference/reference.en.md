### Introduction

**This document** is the BEMHTML reference book.

This document describes:

* the basic features of BEMHTML;
* the syntax of BEMJSON input data and BEMHTML templates;
* the input data processing sequence and HTML generation;
* examples of typical problems solving by means of BEMHTML.

**The target audience of this document** is web-developers and HTML-coders who are using the [BEM-methodology](http://bem.info/method/).

We assume that reader is familiar with:

* HTML;
* JavaScript;
* CSS;
* BEM.

Setup of the development environment and templates compilation procedures **are not described in this document**.

### BEMHTML Features

<a id="bem_area"></a>

#### Binding to the BEM Subject Domain

The templating engine BEMHTML is one of the technological solutions, that are ensuring creation of web-interfaces according to the [BEM-methodology](http://bem.info/method/).

The BEMHTML input data is a BEM-tree in [BEMJSON](#bemjson) format, it describes the web-page.
The pattern language of BEMHTML provides a special structures for processing blocks, elements and modifiers.

<a id="decl_templatе"></a>

#### Declarative Templates

<a id="imperativ"></a>

##### Imperative Approach

Standard templating engines are using **imperative approach** for the templates: HTML is formed by consistent reading and applying of the templates.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>The Input Data</th>
    <th>Template</th>
    <th>The Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>
        <pre><code>
{
  items: [
    { text: '1' },
    { text: '2' }
  ]
}
        </code></pre>
    </td>

    <td>
        <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="menu"&gt;
    [% foreach item in items %]
        &lt;li class="menu__item"&gt;
            [% item.text %]
        &lt;/li&gt;
    [% end %]
&lt;/ul&gt;
        </code></pre>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="menu"&gt;
    &lt;li class="menu__item">1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="menu__item">2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        </code></pre>
    </td>

</tr>
</table>

In such templates the redundancy caused by the syntactic requirements of the HTML(the opening
tag - generated content - the closing tag) is inevitable. The redundancy is even higher for tables, lists, etc.

<a id="declarativ"></a>

##### Declarative Approach

Declarative approach allows us to write templates in form of sets of descriptive statement with the following structure: *the input data type (BEM-entity) — HTML representation (tag, attribute, etc.)*.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>The Input Data</th>
        <th>Template</th>
        <th>The Result</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        <pre><code>
{
    block: 'menu',
    content: [
        { elem: 'item', content: '1' },
        { elem: 'item', content: '2' }
    ]
}
        </code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>
        <pre><code>
block menu {
    tag: 'ul'
    elem item, tag: 'li'
}
        </code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>
        <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="menu"&gt;
    &lt;li class="menu__item"&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="menu__item"&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        </code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The generation procedure of an HTML-item is standardized in BEMHTML and performed by the templating engine. Such approach allows us to use the declarative templates. The same approach is used for the data transformation in XSLT and AWK.

<a id="descriptionlanguage"></a>

#### The Description Language — JavaScript

BEMHTML is a specialized language (DSL) which is **dilating** JavaScript.

More precisely, BEMHTML is a superset of [XJST](https://github.com/veged/xjst/) pattern language, which is a superset of JavaScript.

BEMHTML syntax provides a short notation for the correspondence between BEM-entities and generation of HTML elements an attributes.
Besides that, **any** JavaScript constructions can be used in templates.

<a id="execution_language"></a>

#### Templates' Execution Language — JavaScript

BEMHTML is compiled before the execution into an optimized JavaScript, which receives BEMJSON data and returns HTML.

Such template can be executed at the server side as well at the client side.

<a id="restrictions"></a>

#### Restrictions

BEMHTML developers tried to create a tool with maximal flexibility, so BEMHTML is not provided with any technological limitations on the operations performed in the templates. In fact, everything that is possible in JavaScrip, is possible in BEMHTML-code.

All restrictions, which are ensuring the correctness and effectiveness of the performance, are implemented at the level of agreements on templates writing.
Such agreements are provided in this document as a guideline.
Therefore it's possible not to follow the conventions, however in this case it is necessary to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the new solutions.

<a id="basic"></a>

### The Main Terms

<a id="inputdata"></a>

#### The Input Data: BEMJSON

Since BEMHTML is based on JavaScript, JSON with a set of supplemental agreements on BEM-entities (BEMJSON) is selected for the format of BEM-tree.

In order to maintain flexibility and maintainability, any complex transformations of input data shouldn't be performed at the level of a templating engine.
The templates should have a form of simplest possible statements that map each type of BEM-entity to HTML-representation.

For these reasons, structure of the BEM-tree should be view-oriented, so there won't be need to change the set of blocks, elements and their order during the process of HTML-tree generation.
BEM-tree should be transformed into a view-oriented format at the back-end level (before passing it to the templating engine).
A good example of view-oriented data format you can find in the section [Transformation of the input data into a view-oriented format](#bringing_input).

At the same time, the details of an HTML-page organization, which is the front-end developer's responsibility, should be determined only at the level of the templating engine.
You can find an example of implementation of such solution in the chapter [Adding BEM-entities for solving layout problems](#additionbem).

**See also**:

  * [BEMJSON syntax](#bemjson)

<a name="templatebemjson"></a>

#### The Template

The unit of BEMHTML program is a **template**. BEMHTML template associates an input BEM-entity (which is specified by the entity name, the element name and the value of modifier) with the corresponding HTML-element.

The template consists of the following parts:

  * the **predicate**, it is a set of conditions under which the template will be applied. A typical predicate describes the properties of the input BEM-entity;
  * the **body**, it contains the instructions for output HTML generation.

**See also**:

* [BEMHTML syntax](#bemhtml)

<a name="moda"></a>

#### The Mode

During runtime the templating engine successively reeds nodes of the input BEM-tree.
It runs a cycle of output HTML-element generation for each node (BEM-entity).
For nested entities the cycle of HTML-elements generation is run recursively.
Therefore the output HTML-tree is formed element by element during the processing of the input BEM-tree.

The generation cycle of each element sequentially passes through a series of phases which are called **modes**.
Each of these modes is responsible for a certain part of the generated HTML-element(the tag, attributes, class, etc).
The appropriate template is selected and executed for the each mode.

The modes allows us to divide an input element into the fragments.
For description of each fragment a simple data-type can be used: strings are used for tag and class, a dictionary is used for attributes, booleans are used to describe the need of HTML-classes, etc.

Thus it's possible to write declarative templates with a mode specified in template's predicate, and the data(of simple type which is corresponded to the mode) contained in the template's body. In this case the full representation of HTML-element can be defined with a several templates.

The **[default mode](#default)** has a special status. It's responsible for the entire generation of an HTML-element. This mode defines: the set and the order for processing the other modes corresponded to the fragments of HTML-element, the procedure of final build of an HTML-element representations from the fragments generated in the other modes.

The template which redefines the behavior in the default mode gives us the total control on elements generation from BEMHTML.

**See also**:

* [The standard modes](#standardmoda)

<a name="context"></a>

#### The Context

During processing of the input BEMJSON-tree, the tempating engine builds **the context**. It's a data structure which is accessible during the time when template are being applied. The context corresponds to the current element (node) of the input BEM-tree. It includes:

* normalized information about the current BEM-entity;
* a fragment of the original input data (current BEMJSON-tree element and its descendants);
* a string buffer in which the resulting HTML is being written;
* service fields that contain information about the current state (mode, position in the input BEM-tree, etc.);
* auxiliary functions.

BEM-entity, which is described by the current context, is called a **context entity**.

**See also**:

* [The context fields](#context_field)
* [Completing BEM-entities with help of the context](#extensionbem)

<a name="bemjson"></a>

### BEMJSON Syntax

<a id="datatype"></a>

#### The Data Type

Data types in BEMJSON are similar to the corresponding JavaScript types.

* Strings and numbers:
 * **String** `` 'a' `` `"a"`;
 * **Number** `1` `0.1`;

   A data structure, which consists of a string or number, is a valid BEMJSON.

* **Object** (an associative array) '{key: value}' and other types except an array.

* **Array**, it may contain elements of different type (strings, numbers, objects, arrays)
  `[ "a", 1, {key: value}, [ "b", 2, ... ] ]`.

<a id="fields_bemjson"></a>

#### BEMJSON Special Fields

To represent BEM and HTML subject domain data in BEMJSON, objects with special reserved field names are used.

<a name="notionbem"></a>

##### Representation of BEM-Entities

BEM-entities are represented in BEMJSON as objects, which can have the following fields:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Filed</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Value's Type</th>
    <th>Examplw</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>block</code></td>
    <td>Block's name</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td><code>{ block: 'b-menu' }</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td><code>elem</code></td>
    <td>Element's name</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td><code>{ elem: 'item' }</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td><code>mods</code></td>
    <td>Block's modifiers</td>
    <td>An object that contains names and values of modifiers in form of a pairs key-value:
        <code>{the_name_of_modifier: 'the_value_of_modifier'}</code>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>
{
  block: 'b-link',
  mods: { pseudo: 'yes', color: 'green' }
}
        </code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td><code>elemMods</code></td>
    <td>Element's modifiers</td>
    <td>An object that contains names and values of modifiers in form of pairs key-value:
        <code>{name_of_modifier: 'value_of_modifier'}</code>
    </td>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>
{
  elem: 'item',
  elemMods: { selected: 'yes' }
}
        </code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td><code>mix</code></td>
    <td>Mixed blocks / elements</td>
    <td>An array of objects that describe mixed blocks and elements. An object is also acceptable, it will be interpreted as an array with a single element.</td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>
{
  block: 'b-link',
  mix: [ { block: 'b-serp-item', elem: 'link' } ]
}
        </code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

**See also**:

* [Completing BEM-entities with help of the context](#extensionbem)

<a name="notionhtml"></a>

##### HTML representation

BEMJSON provides ability to specify certain aspects of the output HTML directly in the input data.
This capability shouldn't be abused. BEMJSON is a data level, so HTML layout should be build at the level of the templating engine (BEMHTML).
However, there are some situations where the description of HTML-representation at the BEMJSON level is warrantable.
In this case, the author of BEMHTML templates should understand how the HTML parameters, specified in the input data, interact with HTML-representation defined at the templates' level.

BEMJSON provides the following fields for the direct management of HTML-representation:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Value's type</th>
    <th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>tag</code></td>
    <td>HTML-tag for the given entity</td>
    <td><code>String</code></td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b-my-block',
  tag: 'img'
}</code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>attrs</code></td>
    <td>HTML-attributes for the given entity</td>
    <td><code>Object</code></td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b-my-block',
  tag: 'img',
  attrs: { src: '//yandex.ru/favicon.ico', alt: '' }
}</code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>cls</code></td>
    <td>Line which will be added to the HTML-attribute<code>class</code> (besides the automatically generated classes)</td>
    <td><code>String</code></td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b-my-block',
  cls: 'some-blah-class'
}</code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>bem</code></td>
    <td>The flag for cancellation the generation of BEM-class attribute in the HTML- <code>class</code> for the given entity</td>
    <td><code>Boolean</code></td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b-page',
  tag: 'html',
  bem: false
}</code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>js</code></td>
    <td>Either the flag that indicates the presence of a client-side JavaScript in the entity, or JavaScript parameters.</td>
    <td><code>Boolean</code></td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b-form-input',
  mods: { autocomplete: 'yes' },
  js: {
    dataprovider: { url: 'http://suggest.yandex.ru/...' }
  }
}</code></pre>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

Please note that names and meaning of the BEMJSON fields, that are managing HTML-representation, are the same as the names and the meaning of the corresponding BEMHTML [standard modes](# standardmoda) (tag, attributes, class, etc.).
If some aspects of the output HTML are **defined in the input data, and in BEMHTML-templates**, the higher priority have the definition given in BEMHTML-templates.

When generating HTML one of the following actions will be done:

  * **Merge** of the values of HTML-parameters specified in BEMJSON with values of parameters specified in BEMHTML-template. Merge of the values is performed only for the parameters that have an obvious meaning: `attrs`, `js`, `mix`.
  * **Replacement** of the values of HTML-parameters specified in the BEMJSON with the values set in the ** BEMHTML-template**. It holds for the all other values: `tag`, `cls`, `bem`, `content`.

***
**NB** Priority of BEMHTML-templates allows **the templates' author** decide which HTML-parameters will have top-priority for each case (the parameters set in BEMHTML or in BEMJSON).
The values of HTML-parameters specified in BEMJSON are available in templates when addressing to a fragment of the input BEMJSON-tree in the context of (field `this.ctx`).
***

<a name="nesting"></a>

##### Nesting: Content

For representation of nested BEM-entities (BEM-tree) BEMJSON has the reserved field `content`. Its value can be set to an arbitrary BEMJSON:

 * A primitive data type (string, number). The value is used as a content (text) of the HTML-element corresponded to the context entity.
 * An object which describes the BEM-tree. The value is used for generation of HTML-elements nested in the corresponding to the context entity HTML-element.

There is no limitations on nesting depth of the tree of BEM-entities build with help of the `content` field.

**See also**:

* [The content mode](#content)

<a id="custom_fields"></a>

##### Arbitrary Fields

In addition to special fields, that describe a BEM-entity and its HTML-representation, the object may have any fields with an arbitrary data. This data will be available for use in BEMHTML-templates.

An example of an arbitrary field is a field `url` in the reference block:

```js
{
  block: 'b-link',
  url: '//yandex.ru'
}
```

An example of use of an arbitrary data field can be found in section [Template selection based on the condition](#select_template).

<a name="customjs"></a>

#### Arbitrary JavaScript in BEMJSON

Format of BEMJSON has less restrictions than JSON. Arbitrary JavaScript-expressions are valid BEMJSON.

Particularity of BEMJSON format involves adherence to the agreements on objects' fields naming (for BEM-entities and HTML-representation), which were mentioned in the previous sections, and the rules of objects nesting.

<a name="bemhtml"></a>

###BEMHTML Syntax

This section describes all syntactic structures of BEMHTML.

<a name="template"></a>

#### Template

A template consists of two expressions: **predicate** and **body**; which are separated with a colon.
Any number of spaces or its absence before and after the colon is allowed:

```
predicate: body
```

Each **predicate** is a list of one or more **sub-predicates** (conditions) separated by commas.

```
subpredicate1, subpredicate2, subpredicate3: body
```

The comma corresponds to the logical "AND".
The predicate evaluates to true if only all sub-predicates evaluate to true.
The order of sub-predicates doesn't matter, *there is no guarantee on the order in which sub-predicates will be checked*.

From the logic's point of view, a BMHTML program is a flat **list of templates**.
However, if multiple templates have **common sub-predicates**, they can be written as a nested structure in order to minimize the code repetition.

Curly brackets are used to represent a nested structure. The brackets are placed after the common part of the predicates, and a block of code that contains distinct parts of predicates and corresponding to them templates's bodies are paced inside the curly brackets.
Nesting depth of sub-predicates is not limited.


```
subpredicate1 {
  subpredicate2: body1
  subpredicate3: body2
}
```

It's equivalent to:

```
subpredicate1, subpredicate2: body1
subpredicate1, subpredicate3: body2
```

----
**NB** If for the given context more than one template was defined, the **last** (in the listing order)template in BEMHTML-file will be executed.
The specific templates should be listed after the more general ones.
***

**See also**:

* [Check of the predicates in a certain order](#check_predicate)

<a name="podpredicate"></a>

#### Sub-predicates

A template's predicate is a set of conditions that describe when the template should be applied.
A template's sub-predicate is an elementary condition.

BEMHTML provides the following types of conditions:

* Match of the input BEM-tree.
* Mode.
* Arbitrary condition.


##### Match of the Input BEM-Tree.

Conditions on match of the input BEM-tree allow us describe the applicability of the templates in terms of BEM-entities: blocks' and elements' names, names and values of modifiers.

For this purpose the following keywords are used in predicates:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Keyword</th>
    <th>Arguments</th>
    <th>Value's Type</th>
    <th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>block</code></td>
    <td>the block's name</td>
    <td>identifier <code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+ </code> or arbitrary js-expression</td>
    <td><pre><code>block b-menu, block 'b-menu', block 'b' + '-menu'</code></pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>elem</code></td>
    <td>the element's name</td>
    <td>identifier <code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+</code> or arbitrary js-expression</td>
    <td><pre><code>block b-menu, elem item</code></pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>mod</code></td>
    <td>the name and value of block's modifier</td>
    <td>identifier <code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+ </code> or arbitrary js-expression</td>
    <td><pre><code>block b-head-logo, mod size big</code></pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><code>elemMod</code></td>
   <td>the name and value of block's element</td>
   <td>identifier <code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+ </code> or arbitrary js-expression</td>
   <td><pre><code>block b-head-logo, elem text, elemMod size big</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

Identifiers of blocks, elements, modifiers and their values are written without quotes.
BEMHTML parser accepts any string that consists of Latin characters and the hyphen as an identifier.
Instead of identifier any JavaScript-expression can be used, it will be converted into a string.

----
**NB** Don't be confused with the block's modifiers and the element's modifiers in predicates.

 * `block input, mod theme black, elem hint` defines an element `hint` nested into the block `input` with **the block's modifier** `theme` and the modifier's value `black`.
 * `block input, elem hint, elemMod visibility visible` defines an element `hint` with **the element's modifier** `visibility` with value `visible`, the element is nested into the block `input`.
 * `block input, mod theme black, elem hint, elemMod visibility visible` defines an element `hint` with **the element's modifier** `visibility` set to the value `visible`, the element is nested into the block `input` which has **the block's modifier** `theme` set to the value `black`.

For blocks' and elements' modifiers different keywords are used, therefore in predicates it's possible to combine conditions for modifiers of blocks and elements.
***

<a name="moda2"></a>

##### Mode

The name of any [standard modes](#standardmoda) can be used as a predicate.
It mens that the given predicate will be evaluated to true when the corresponding mode is set.

For checking of the standard modes the following keywords are used:

* `default`
* `tag`
* `bem`
* `mix`
* `cls`
* `js`
* `jsAttr`
* `attrs`
* `content`

Besides that, any sub-predicate, which consists of only one identifier (`[a-zA-Z0-9-]+`), will be interpreted as a name of a standard mode.
For example, the sub-predicate `my-mode` is equivalent to the predicate `` this._mode === 'my-mode' ``.

<a name="random_condition"></a>

##### Arbitrary Condition

Arbitrary conditions are taking into account matching of the data, which is not a part of BEM subject domain.
Any JavaScript-expression, which can be evaluated to a boolean, can be used as an arbitrary condition.

***
**NB** It's preferable to write arbitrary conditions in the <a name="xjst-canonical"></a> **canonical XJST form**:

```
predicate expression === value
```

Where
* `predicate expression` is an arbitrary JavaScript expression, which can be evaluated to boolean;
* `value` is an arbitrary JavaScript expression.

At the same time, the number of **different** predicate expressions in sub-predicates should be minimized.
Abidance of this recommendations allows XJST compiler perform optimization of templates' arbitrary conditions together with the standard conditions'(BEM-entities and modes) optimization.
***

<a name="body"></a>

#### The Body

A template's body is an expression, the result of its evaluation is used for output HTML generation.
For a template's body can be used:

* a JavaScript-expression:

  ```
  predicate: JS-expression
  ```
* A block of JavaScript code placed into curly brackets:

  ```
  predicate: { JS-bloxk }
  ```

***
**NB** BEMHTML parser always interprets curly brackets as a notation for a JavaScrip-code block, therefore if one needs to use hash (object) inside a template's body as a JavaScript-expression, the object should be placed into a round brackets:

```
predicate: ({name: value})
```
***

Within a template's body it's possible to perform the following actions:

* Calculate and return a value.
  If the current mode a value of the particular type is expected, the result of template's body evaluation will be converted into the expected type and used.
  If the template doesn't return any value, the value `undefined` will be used.
* Write some data directly into the HTML-result.
  For this purpose one should write the data into the buffer of HTML-result (`this._buf.push(…)`).
* Perform arbitrary operations.

<a id="xjst"></a>

#### XJSLT Constructions

Since BEMHTML is an extension of [XJST](https://github.com/veged/xjst) language,
it's possible to use XJST syntax constructions in BEMHTML-templates to modify the context and call procedures for template selecting and its implementation within the new (modified) context.

<a id="local"></a>

##### local

The construction `local` (XJST) is used for temporary change of the context, variables, and further operations with them.
Syntax of the `local` code block is similar to the JavaScript blocks `while` and `for`.

The block `local` can be written in the following ways:

* The body in the form of js-expression

    ```
    local(expressions) code

    ```
* The body in the form of js-block:

    ```
    local(expressions) { code }
    ```

Here

* `expressions` is a list of expressions, which are variables assignment;
* `code` is a JavaScript-code, which is executed in a context with values assigned to the variables in the `expressions` bock.

After leaving the block `local` all variables whose values were changed in the block `expressions`, acquire their original values (the values they had before the execution of the block `expressions`).
The variables get back their original values in the order reverse to the order of variables assignment performed in the block `expressions`.

---
**NB** If a variable (an object field), that wasn't previously defined, is assigned to a value within the block `expressions`, it will exist after leaving the block 'local', but its value will be set to 'undefined`.
***

**See also**:

* More detailed information about the block `local` can be found in [XJST reference book](http://github.com/veged/xjst/blob/master/README.md#local)

<a id="apply"></a>

##### apply

The construction `apply` serves for explicit call of the selection and execution procedures for a template with a predicate that evaluates to true in the given context. 'apply' allows us to call templates in the modified context.

The syntax:

```js
apply(expressions)
```
where `expressions` is a list of expressions which are modifying the context. This list can be empty.

Each of the expressions in the `expressions` list can be:

* an operation of variables assignment. It's similar to the block `expressions` of the [`local` construction](#local).
* *new in bem-bl 0.3.* a string or an expression that can be converted into a string. It means: «use the given string as a mode name».

For example, the expression `apply('content')` is equivalent to `apply(this._mode = 'content')`.

When evaluating the expression `apply` the following steps will be done:
 1. Expressions evaluation (assignment) of the block `expressions`.
 2. The call of templates' selection and execution procedures in the context obtained at the step 1.
 3. Restore the values of variables.

The construction `apply(expressions)` is a short form of the expression `local(expressions) { apply() }`.

<a id="applynext"></a>

##### applyNext

*New in bem-bl 0.3.*

The construction `applyNext` allows us to re-start the process of templates application to the current context directly in the template body.
The result is obtained in way way as if the template, in which the construction is executed, doesn't exist.
The construction returns a value obtained by the templates' application to the current context.

The syntax:

```js
applyNext(expressions)
```

where `expressions` is a list of expressions which are modifying the context (variables assignment or a string that means a mode assignment). This list can be empty. It's similar to the block `expressions` of the [`apply` construction](#apply).

When `applyNext` is called the following steps will be done:

  1. A flag is created in the context in order to prevent an infinite recursion. A random number is used as a flag.
  2. Check of the flag existence is added into the templates' predicate.
  3. Execution of the block `expressions` (modification of the current context).
  4. The call of the template's `apply()` selection and execution procedure.
  5. The value obtained by the template's execution is returned.

For example the template

```js
block b1: {
    statements
    applyNext()
}
```

is equivalent to the following template:

```js
var _randomflag = ~~(Math.random() * 1e9)
block b1, !this.ctx[_randomflag]: {
    statements
    local(this.ctx[_randomflag] = true) apply()
}
```

where `statements` is arbitrary JavaScript-expressions allowed in the template's body.

<a id="applyctx"></a>

##### applyCtx

The construction `applyCtx` is designed to modify a fragment of input BEM-tree `this.ctx` and then call the procedure of templates' applying `apply()` in the context of the modified BEM-tree.

Syntax:

```js
applyCtx(newctx)
```
Where for `newctx` it's possible to use:

* An object (hash) which will be used as an input fragment of BEM-tree. It might contain links to the original `this.ctx`.
* A variable assignment.

During evaluation of the expression `applyCtx` the following steps performed:

  1. To prevent an infinite recursion when calling templates a flag is created in the context. A random number is used for the flag.
  2. The flag existence check is added to the templates' predicate.
  3. The current mode is set to the [empty mode](#empty_moda).
  4. The call of the selection and execution procedure of the template `apply ()`.
  5. The value obtained by the template's execution is returned.

The expression `applyCtx(newctx)` is a short form of the expression `applyNext(this.ctx = {newctx}, '')`.

<a name="standardmoda"></a>

### Standard Modes

At the core of BEMHTML a set of standard modes is defined. They determine the order of input BEM-tree (BEMJSON) bypass and the generation of output HTML, that is used by BEMHTML by default.

By functionality the modes can be divided into two classes:

  * **The «Empty» Mode** defines the bypass algorithm for input BEMHTML nodes and for the call of other modes;
  * All other modes define the order for the output HTML generation. In each of such modes a fragment of the output HTML-tree is formed.

For HTML generation in each mode the procedures of selection and execution of a suitable template (a predicate of the template has to evaluate to true) are called.
The fragment of output HTML-tree (HTML-element) for which the current mode is responsible is substituted with the result of the template's body evaluation.

Such approach places the following restrictions on the templates:

  * If the template writes some date into HTML, in its predicate a mode should be specified.
  * The maximum number of modes that can be specified in a predicate is one.
  * A template's body should evaluate to a value of the type which is expected for the current mode.

In the following sections the modes are listed in the order of its call when an element of the input BEMJSON is being processed.

<a name="empty_moda"></a>

#### The «Empty» Mode (`""`)

*The type of a template's body: `not used`*

The empty (not defined) mode corresponds to the situation when the context field `this._mode` equals to an empty string (`""`). This value is set in the following cases:

  * before the beginning of the input tree processing;
  * during recursive call of the tree bypass in the `default` mode.

The action, that will be performed in the empty mode, is defined by the type of the context (the current context) element of the input BEMJSON-tree.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Element's Type</th>
    <th>Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>BEM-entity</b>(block or element)</td>
    <td>Setting the values of the context service fields (<code>block elem mods elemMods ctx position</code>)
    and templates' call in the mode <code>default</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>string/number</th>
    <td>Output of the value converted into a string to the HTML-result buffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Boolean, undefined, null</th>
    <td>Output of an empty string to the buffer of HTML-result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>array</th>
    <td>Iteration through an array with recursive call of templates in empty mode.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Definition of a template in the empty mode (sub-predicate `this._mode ===" "`) makes sense if only one needs to override the bypass principle for the input tree.

The call of templates in empty mode (the construction `apply('')` in the template's body) is necessary if one needs to deviate from the univocal correspondence "input BEM-entity - the output HTML-element" and generate more than one item from one input entity.
In particular, such call can be performed automatically when using [constructions `applyCtx`](# applyctx).

  * [Wrapping up a block into another block](#wrappingunit)

<a id="default"></a>

#### default

*The type of a template's body: `not used`*

In the mode `default` the entire output HTML-element corresponding to the input BEM-entity is formed.

During the execution of the mode `default` the following actions are taking place:

  * the call of all other standard modes which are responsible for the different aspects of HTML-element;
  * merge of the results of all called modes execution into a resulting string;
  * a recursive call of templates for the result of execution of the mode `content`.

The figure below shows in which modes the different fragments of the output HTML-element are generated.

![mode-default](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_default.png)

The figure represents the case of processing an element which has a pair (opening and closing) of tags and attached content.
Processing of short (closed in the start tag) elements is similar to the represented in the figure above. The only difference is the absence of the closing tag and recursion.
The context auxiliary function `this._.isShortTag` depending on the element's (tag) name decides if the current element should be processed as the short one.

Template's definition in the mode `default` (sub-predicate `default`) is needed in case when you need to override the generation process of the output HTML-element, for example, to add DOCTYPE to the tag HTML:

```js
block b-page {
  default: {
    this._buf.push('<!DOCTYPE html>');
    applyNext();
  }
  tag: 'html'
}
```

<a id="tag"></a>

#### tag

* *Type of the template's body: `String`*
* *The default value: `` 'div' ``*

The mode `tag` specifies the name of an input HTML-element (the tag). By default the element's name is `div`. In the figure below the fragments for which the mode `tag` is responsible are highlighted:

![mode-tag](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_tag.png)

***
**NB** If the value of `tag` was set to an empty string, then for the given entity the step of HTML-element generation (tag and attributes generation) will be skipped, but the element's content will be processed in a standard way.
***

Template's definition in the mode `tag` (sub-predicate `tag`) is necessary in the following cases:

  * for the given entity one needs to generate an HTML-element with the name different form `div`;
  * if there is no need to generate an HTML-element for the given entity, but the nested entities should be processed.

<a id="js"></a>

#### js

* *Type of the template's body: `Boolean|Object`*
* *The default value: `false`*

The mode `js` indicates if the block, that is being processed, has a client-side JavaScript.
In the case the block has JavaScript, it's possible to pass the JavaScript parameters in the mode `js`. The parameters will be written to an HTML-element attribute specified by [the mode `jsAttr`](#jsattr).

The mode `js` accepts two types for the template's body:

  * `Boolean` is a flag that specifies if the given block has a client-side JavaScript.
  * `Object` is a hash which contains JavaScript parameters (it's assumed that the given block has a client-side JavaScript).

In the figure below the elements, for which generation the mode `js` is responsible, are of highlighted:

![mode-js](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_js.png)

The template's definition in the mode `js` (sub-predicate `js`) makes sense if only the block has a client-side JavaScript.

<a id="bem"></a>

#### bem

* *The type of a template's body: `Boolean`*
* *The default value: `true`*

The `bem` mode specifies whether the auto-generated class names, that describe the BEM-entity, should be included in the HTML-attribute `class`.
By default, the BEM-classes are generated.
A fragment of HTML, for which generation the mode `bem` is responsible, is highlighted in the figure below:

![mode-bem](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_bem.png)

Template's definition in the mode `bem` (sub-predicate `bem`) makes sense if only for the given entity there is **no need** to generate HTML-classes related to the BEM subject domain.
It may be necessary for the compliance with the HTML syntax requirements.
For example, the tag `html`, `meta`, `link`, `script`, `style` can not have the attribute `class`.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Input Data</th>
    <th>Template</th>
    <th>HTML-Result</th>

    <td>
        <pre><code>{

  tag: 'html'
  bem: false
}</code></pre>

    <td><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<a id="cls"></a>

#### cls

* *The type of a template's body: `String`*
* *The default value: ``*

The mode `cls` allows us to define an arbitrary string which will be added to the attribute `class` besides the automatically-generated values.
The `cls` is responsible for the fragment which is highlighted in the figure below:

![mode-cls](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_cls.png)

Template's definition in the mode `cls` (sub-predicate `cls`) makes sense if only for the given element the specific HTML-classes, which are not related to the BEM subject domain, are necessary.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Input Data</th>
    <th>Template</th>
    <th>HTML-Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b1'
}</code></pre>
    </td>
    <td><pre><code>block b1, cls: 'custom'</code></pre></td>
    <td><pre><code>&lt;div class="b1 custom"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<a id="mix"></a>

#### mix

* *The type of a template's body: `Array|Object`*
* *The default value: `[]`*

The mode `mix` specifies a list of BEM-entities which should be admixed to the given entity.
The entity, within which confines the mixing is performed, is called the **base** entity, and the added entity is called the **admixed**. It makes sense to admix blocks and elements.

Technically the admixture reduces to the following operations:

  * BEM-classes of the admixed entity are added to the value of the `class` attribute of the current element, along with the base entity's classes;
  * If the admixed entity has JavaScript-parameters, they are added to the value of the attribute specified by the mode `jsAttr`. JavaScript-parameters are passed as a hash, where the key is the name of the admixed entity.

All other components of an HTML-element (tag and attributes) are generated based on templates for the base entity.

The value of the template's body for a given mode can be:

  * An **array** which contains a list of objects (hashes), each of those objects describes BEM-entities which are needed to be admixed with the base entity.
  * An **object** which describes the admixed BEM-entity. It's interpreted as an array with one element.

The HTML-fragment, for the generation of which the mode `mix` is responsible, is highlighted in the picture below:

![mode-mix](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_mix.png)

The template's definition for mode `mix` (sub-predicate `mix`) is required when one needs admixing of a block or element at the level of the templating engine.

***
**NB** The admixing of BEM-entities is executed recursively.
In other words, if for the admixed entity template, in which it has admixture with other entities, is defined, all these entities are added recursively and classes for all of them will appear in the `class` attribute of the base entity (see example below).

<a id="jsAttr"></a>

####jsAttr

* *The type of a template's body: `String`*
* *The default value: `'onclick'`*

The mode `jsAttr` defines name of HTML-attribute in the value of which the client-side JavaScript parameters for the given block will be passed.
By default the attribute `onclick` is used.
In the figure below the HTML-fragment, for generation of which the mode `jsAttr` is responsible, is highlighted:

![mode-jsattr](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_jsattr.png)

The template's definition in the  mode `jsAttr` (sub-predicate `jsAttr`) is necessary if one needs to pass the JavaScript parameters in nonstandard attribute.
For example, for the touch-sites for this purpose the attribute `ondblclick` is used.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Input Data</th>
    <th>Template</th>
    <th>HTML-Result</th>

<tr>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{

    <td><pre><code>block b1, jsAttr: 'ondblclick'</code></pre></td>
    <td><pre><code>&lt;div class="b1 i-bem"
    ondblclick="return {'b1': {} }"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<a id="attrs"></a>

#### attrs

* *The type of a template's body: `Object`*
* *The default value: `{}`*

The mode `attrs` allows us specify names of arbitrary HTML-attributes for the given element.
By default the additional attributes are not generated.
The HTML-fragment, for generation of which the mode `attrs` is responsible, is highlighted in the figure below:

![mode-attrs](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_attrs.png)

The value of a template's body for the given mode should be an object (hash), which keys and values are names and values of the attributes.
A valid identifier of an HTML-attribute should be used for a key, and a string or a number should be used for the value.
When using a special characters in attribute values, they are escaped with the auxiliary function `this._.attrEscape()`.

***
**NB** If value of an attribute set to `undefined`, this attribute won't be outputted to the HTML-element.
***

A template should be defined in the mode `attrs` (sub-predicate `attrs`) in the following cases:

  * One needs to add an arbitrary attributes at the level of the templating egine;
  * The specified attributes should be excluded from the output, even if they were defined in the input BEMJSON.

<a name="content"></a>

#### content

* *The type of a template's body: `BEMJSON`*
* *The default value: `this.ctx.content`*

In the mode `content` content of an HTML-element is computed, which can be a random BEMJSON (such as a string or a number, or a BEM-entities tree).
As a default value the `content` field value of the context BEM-entity (`this.ctx.content`) is used.

The HTML-fragment, for generation of which the mode `content` is responsible, is highlighted in the figure below:

![mode-content](https://raw.github.com/bem/bemhtml/master/common.docs/reference/reference_mode_content.png)

The definition of a template in the mode `content` (sub-predicate `content`) is necessary in the following cases:

 * At the level of the templating engine it's necessary to add a content for the entity that doesn't have `content` in the input BEMJSON.
 * It's necessary to replace the entity's content at the level of the templating engine.

### The Context Fields

During the runtime BEMHTML templating engine builds a data structure that contains information about the processing BEMJSON node and the state of the processing.
In addition, several auxiliary functions BEMHTML are available in the context.

During the template's execution the context is available as an object, which is denoted by the keyword `this`. It's accessible from the predicate, as well as from the template's body.

A template's author can define any additional fields in the context.

All fields can be divided into two categories:

  * **Context-dependent**, whose values vary depending on the node which is being processed and the processing phase.
  * **Context-independent**, whose values are unchanging.

**See also**:

  * [The Context](#context)

***
**NB** Keywords for checking BEM-entities in the predicate are shorthand for checking the values of the fields `block`, `elem`, etc. in the current context. For example, sub-predicate `block b1` is equivalent to sub-predicate `this.block === 'b1'`.

Similarly, the key words for the mode checking in the predicate are shorthand for checking the value of
service field `_mode` in the current context. For example, sub-predicate `tag` equivalent to sub-predicate
`this._mode === 'tag'`.

##### Completing BEM-Entities With Help of the Context

In BEMJSON BEM-entities are usually written in a minimized form. For example, the element `item` is nested into the block `menu`; in the object, which describes the menu item, the name of the menu block, that contains it, is not specified:

```js
{
  block: 'menu',
  content: {
    elem: 'item'
  }
}
```

During operation of the templating engine, the fact that `item` belongs to the block `menu` will be established form the context (based on the nesting). When the block `menu` is the context entity, the context fields will have the following values:

```js
this.block: 'menu'
this.ctx.block: 'menu'
```

At the time of entry into the sub-element `item`, the field `this.block` is being completed with the value `menu`.
At the same time, the field `this.ctx.block` has the value `undefined`, since in the input BEMJSON this field for the element `item` is not defined:

```js
this.block: 'menu'
this.elem: 'item'
this.ctx.block: undefined
this.ctx.elem: 'item'
```

The elements, which were admixed inside blocks, will be also completed. For example, for the following BEM-tree:

```js
{ block: 'b1', mix: { elem: 'e1' } }
```

In admixed element the block's name will be completed:

```js
{ block: 'b1', mix: { block: 'b1', elem: 'e1' } }
```

Completing of the BEM-entities is necessary for the correct work of predicates with the blocks' elements of the form `block menu, elem item`, since in such predicates the context fields `this.block` and `this.elem` are being checked.

***
**NB** To avoid triggering of the predicate of the form `block menu` nested within a block of elements, at the templates' compilation stage for such predicates the sub-predicate `!this.elem` is automatically added where it's necessary.
If template's predicate contains a sub-predicate with an arbitrary condition, which is not written in the [canonical XJST form](# xjst-canonical), the automatic adding of the sub-predicate may not work.

##### The Algorithm for Computing Position of the BEM-Entity

Position in the BEM-tree (context field `this.position`) is a natural number that indicates the index number of the current (the context one) BEM-entity among its siblings in the BEM-tree (peer entities).

When computing the position:

  * Only the BEMJSON nodes, that correspond to the BEM-entities, are numbered. All other nodes don't have any position number.
  * The position numbering starts from 1.
  * Numbering is performed in the order of the tree traversal (flattened list of the BEMJSON hierarchical representation).

An example of the numbering in the input BEM-tree:

```js
{
  block: 'page',          // this.position === 1
  content: [
    { block: 'head' },    // this.position === 1
    'text',               // this.position === undefined
    {
      block: 'menu',      // this.position === 2
      content: [
        { elem: 'item' }, // this.position === 1
        { elem: 'item' }, // this.position === 2
        { elem: 'item' }  // this.position === 3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

***
**NB** BEM-tree can be completed during the process of templates' implementation with help of templates in the mode `contend` and templates in the empty mode.
Such dynamic change of the BEM-tree is taken into account in the position calculation.
***

The function `this.isLast ()`, which serves for determining the last BEM-entity among the sibling, won't work if the last element is not a BEM-entity.
For example:

```js
{
  block: 'b1',
  content: [
    { block: 'b2' },
    { block: 'b3' }, // this.isLast() === false
    'text'
  ]
}
```

Such behavior is explained by the fact that in order to optimize BEMHTML the full preliminary traversal of the BEM-tree is not performed.
Therefore, at the time of processing the block `b3`, length of the array is already known (`b3` is not the last element), but it is not known that the last element is not a BEM-entity, so it won't receive the index number.

In reality, the case of `this.isLast()` incorrect operation described above shouldn't generate errors, because the check on the first / last BEM-entity is usually applied to automatically-generated lists of entities, and including data of other types into this lists doesn't make sense.

#### Context-Independent Fields

All context-independent fields are grouped in the object `this._`. This fields are auxiliary functions, that are used by the templating engine.
Author of templates can also use these functions in the template's body as well as in predicates.

    <th>Field</th>

#### Converting the Input Data into the View-Oriented Format

##### Problem

One needs to form an input BEM-tree for a news feed page (a list of posts with information about the author) which will be easy to handle in terms of BEMHTML templates.
This tree should be view-oriented, i.e. set and order of the BEM-entities should correspond to set and order of the DOM-nodes of an output HTML.

##### Solution

Reduction to the view-oriented format shouldn't be performed by BEMHTML, but at the back-end level of data-preparation. Such back-end usually works with the normalized data (data-oriented format). In the case of news feed, the original data might have the following format:

```js
{
    posts: [ { text: 'post text', author: 'login' }, … ],
    users: [ { 'login': { userpic: 'URL', name: 'Full Name' } }, … ],
}
```

The data is two lists of objects of different type.
Only a user ID is used in the list of posts, and the complete information about the user is contained in the corresponding hash in the list of users.

The view-oriented data format expects denormalizated data, i.e. the deployment of the list of posts in the way that each post contains full information about the author, even if the list contains multiple posts of the same author. In BEMJSON this format might have the following view:

```js
{
    block: 'posts',
    content: [
        {
            block: 'post',
            content: [
                { block: 'userpic', content: 'URL' },
                { block: 'user', content: 'Full Name' },
                { elem: 'text', content: 'post text' }
            ]
        },
        …
    ]
}
```

<a name="select_template"></a>

#### A Template Selection Based on the Condition

##### Problem

Block `b-link` occurs in two varieties:

  * `{ block: 'b-link', content: 'a link without URI' }`
  * `{ block: 'b-link', url: '//ya.ru', content: 'a link with URL' }`

The output HTML-element should be formed differently depending on the presence / absence of the field `url` in the block's data.

##### Solution

Existence of the field `url` should be checked in a template's sub-predicate: the expression `this.ctx.url` will be evaluated to true if only the field `url` is defined.

```js
block b-link {
  tag: 'span'
  this.ctx.url {
    tag: 'a'
    attrs: { href: this.ctx.url }
  }
}
```

It's **wrong** to use JavaScript conditional statement in the template's body for solving this problem:

```js
block b-link, tag: this.ctx.url ? 'a' : 'span'
```

This expression won't be optimized during compilation, so it will have a negative impact on the template's speed.

<a name="inheritage"></a>

#### Inheritance

##### Problem

At the different [redefinition levels](http://bem.info/method/) two different templates for the same BEM-entity (`block b1`) are defined. Each of the templates defines its own content in the mode `content`.

The content, that was defined at the first level of redefinition, should be **inherited** at the second level of redefinition, and also some extra content should be added. One needs an analog of `<xsl:apply-imports/>`.

##### Solution

BEMHTML has an analog of `<xsl:apply-imports/>`.
Its implementation is based on the ability to restart the procedure of templates' application for the current context (`apply()`).
Therefore it's possible to call the same template as was previously defined for the given context (BEM-entities, modes, etc.) or was defined at another level of redefinition.

When evaluating the expression `apply()`, the result obtained by the application of the previously defined template will be returned.
To avoid an infinite loop, the sub-predicate for check of a flag (for example, `_myGuard`) should be added. This flag must be set when executing `apply()`.

```js
// the template at the first level of redefinition
block b1, content: 'text1'

// the template at the first second of redefinition
block b1, content, !this._myGuard: [
    apply(this._myGuard = true), // get the previous value of content
    'text2'
]
```

As a result of the templates' application to the block `b1`, the following HTML will be received:

```xml
<div class="b1">text1text2</div>
```

*In bem-bl version 0.3* the construction `applyNext` was added. It automatically generates a unique name for the flag to prevent an infinite loop.*


```js
block b1, content: 'text1'

block b1, content: [
    applyNext(), // get the previous value of content
    'text2'
]
```

<a name="parentblock"></a>

#### Selection of a Template Depending on the Parent Element

##### Problem

To implement a markup similar to DocBook language, depending on the context in which the given block occurs different templates are needed for the block `para`.
Particularly, a tag `<p>` should not be generated for the block `para`, if it's nested into the block `listitem`.

##### Solution

In BEMHTML(or rather in XJST) there is no implicit saving of the context for using it in predicates. It's made this way for the reasons of performance.

To implement in BEMHTML a context dependence, one has to save explicitly the context information that is required for the processing of the nested blocks.

The context information storing should be implemented in the template for the block `listitem`.
Let's the flag `inListItem`:

```js
block listitem, default, !this.inListItem: apply(this.inListItem=true)
```

Pay attention to the sub-predicate `!this.inListItem`, it allows us avoid an infinite loop during a recursive call of the templates application procedure in a modified context (`apply(this.inListItem=true)`).

To process `para` it's enough to check the presence of the flag `inListItem` in the context.

```js
block para, this.inListItem, tag: ''
```

An empty string in the template's value in the mode `tag` indicates that for this block an HTML-element shouldn't be generated.

#### Wrapping Up a Block into Another Block

##### Problem

One needs to wrap up a block (`b-inner`) into another block (`b-wrapper`) during the template's execution.
Therefore one input block will correspond to two nested into each other blocks.

##### Solution

When processing the block `b-inner` in a template in `default` mode (generation of the entire element), one should modify the fragment of the input tree `this.ctx` (the block `b-wrapper` should be added) and recursively perform a call of the templates in the empty mode `apply(this._mode = "")`.

To avoid an infinite loop the check of the special flag (`_wrap`) should be performed when calling `apply()`. This flag must be set when executing `apply()`.

```js
block b-inner, default, !this.ctx._wrap: apply(
   this._mode = "",
   this.ctx._wrap = true
   this.ctx = {
       block: 'b-wrapper',
       content: this.ctx
   }
)
```

*In bem-bl version 0.3* the construction `applyCtx()` was added. It automatically adds a flag to prevent an infinite loop, assigns `this.ctx` and applies templates in the empty mode:

```js
block b-inner, default: applyCtx({ block: 'b-wrapper', content: this.ctx })
```

***
**NB** The construction `applyCtx()` can be used to **replace** a BEM-entity in the source tree if one doesn't use the original content of the block (`this.ctx`) in the argument of `applyCtx()`.

#### Adding BEM-Entities for Solving Layout Problems

##### Problem

One needs to make a block with rounded corners that works in all browsers (without using CSS3).

Input BEMJSON might might have the following view:

```js
{ block: 'box', content: 'text' }
```

For implementation of rounded corners one has to add four extra elements to the block.
Since these elements are the details of the layout, one shouldn't clutter up the input BEM-tree with these elements.
These elements should be added at the level of BEMHTML-template. The final BEM-tree should look like this:

```js
{
    block: 'box',
    content: {
        elem: 'left-top',
        content: {
            elem: 'right-top',
            content: {
                elem: 'right-bottom',
                content: {
                    elem: 'left-bottom',
                    content: 'text'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


##### Solution

To modify the input BEM-tree at the level of BEMHTML one needs to write a template in the mode `content` for the block `box`.
The fragment of the input BEM-tree is replaced with help of the construction `applyCtx()` (adding the necessary elements), and the substitution of the original content is performed with the help of the construction `applyNext()`.

The BEMHTML-template, which performs this conversion, has the following view:

```js
block box, content: applyCtx({
    elem: 'left-top',
    content: {
        elem: 'right-top',
        content: {
            elem: 'right-bottom',
            content: {
                elem: 'left-bottom',
                content: applyNext()
            }
        }
    }
})
```

* In bem-bl starting from the version 0.3 * a short syntax for templates' application in the certain mode is added:

```js
block b-source, default: apply("", this.ctx.block = 'b-target')
```

#### Use of the BEM-Entity Position

##### Problem

One needs to number menu items starting with 1. The serial number of each menu item with a point should be added to its text.

##### Solution

We use the mechanism for calculating the BEM-entity position among the siblings (the context field `this.position`). The input data may look like this:

```js
{
  block: 'menu',
  content: [
    { elem: 'item', content: 'aaa' },
    { elem: 'item', content: 'bbb' },
    { elem: 'item', content: 'ccc' }
  ]
}
```

To perform the numbering one should write a template in the mode `content` for the menu item. In this template the item's content should be build form the position number, the separator (point with a space) and the original text of the item (can be obtained with help of the construction `applyNext()`):

```js
block menu {
  tag: 'ul'
  elem item {
    tag: 'li'
    content: [
      this.position, '. ',
      applyNext()
    ]
  }
}
```

<a name="check_predicate"></a>

#### Check of The Predicates in a Certain order

##### Problem

One needs to check templates' sub-predicate in a specific order.
For example, one needs at first check the presence of the object `this.world` in the context, and then check value of the field in this object `this.world.answer`.

##### Solution

Let's use the fact that sub-predicate of a BEMHTML-template can be an arbitrary JavaScript-expression, so we can write it in the following form:

```js
(this.world && this.world.answer === 42)
```

This solution has a disadvantage: this expression won't be optimized during compilation, this will have a negative effect on the template's speed.
In the majority of cases, it's possible and necessary to avoid the need of the check of sub-predicates in a strict order.

<a name="binding_html"></a>

#### Binding HTML-elements with Help of ID

##### Problem

For the input block `input` one needs to generate a pair of HTML-elements `<label>` and `<input>`. Value of the attribute `input@id` should be automatically-generated, unique and should match the value of the attribute `label@for`.

The input data can be the following:

```js
{
  block: 'input',
  label: 'My Input',
  content: 'my value'
}
```

##### Solution

To generate a unique ID, that is suitable value of the attribute `id`, let's use the auxiliary function of the context `this.generateId()`. For generation of two HTML-elements based on a single input block, one needs two templates:

  * Template in the mode `tag`. This template indicates an empty string to cancel the generation of HTML-element for the given block. However the content should be processed;
  * Template for the mode `content`, which forms two required elements and their attributes.

```js
block input {
  tag: ''
  content: [
    {
      tag: 'label',
      attrs: { 'for': this.generateId() },
      content: this.ctx.label
    },
    {
      tag: 'input',
      attrs: {
        id: this.generateId(),
        value: this.ctx.content
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
